                He was a devote and humble warden with the job to keep save the arcane knowledge,
                but one day in the bless islands, the lake of life was desecrated, this caused the
                release of a dark magic that killed everyone including Thresh. Instantly everyone
                started coming back in the form of spectres and Thresh was delighted with his new abilities.
                Now he spends his days in the fields of Runaterra snatching the souls of his enemies.

                teammates.
